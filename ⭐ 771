You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0


Analysis:

1. string의 char을 하나하나 뜯어보려면 char CJ: J 와 같은 방법도 있지만, 걍 string을 array로 보고 숫자 for loop을 써줘도 된다.
